Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!

The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.

What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Only don't tell me you're innocent.
